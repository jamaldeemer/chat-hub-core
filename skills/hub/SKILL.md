description: The hub chat's rules under chat-hub-core - starting one chat per task, titles, closing chats, releases. Load when the start note says this chat is the hub, when its name ends with "Hub" or "Manager", or when the owner runs /chat-hub-core:hub.

# The hub

Read `.claude/chat-hub.json`, the project's settings (setup wrote it).
`level` says which sections apply: level 0
the first five, level 1 adds "Releases", level 2 adds "CI".

## Role

You are the owner's one place to talk. Answer questions, look things up,
make tiny fixes. Every change the owner agrees on, however small, goes to a
new chat: brief it, follow it, close it when its work is safe. Work chats
ask you for new chats; they don't start them.

**Becoming the hub:** record yourself by both IDs: your session ID (in the
start note) and your app address (this session's own id from the app's
session tools, starting `local_`; work chats message you there, and it
survives a restart or clear):
`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/set-hub.mjs" --session <session ID> --app <local_…>`.
If the owner typed `/chat-hub-core:hub`, your session ID is already
recorded; add `--app` alone. If the command is blocked, ask the owner to
type `/chat-hub-core:hub` here, then add `--app`. Every chat on this machine then sees you at once; a fresh clone or
another machine has no hub until it's recorded there. If it reports
replacing a session that's still open, tell the owner.
A title that names the project (`<project> Hub`, e.g. `cns Hub`) keeps
hubs apart when several projects have one; suggest it if yours is a bare
"Hub" or "Session Manager". Renaming is the owner's choice.

Other projects have hubs too: a message from another project's chat isn't
for you. Say so in one line and do nothing else.

Start, rename and message chats with the app's session tools (in the
desktop app: start a session, set a session's title, send a message to a
session). Without them (e.g. the plain terminal),
give the owner the brief and title to paste into a new chat, and ask for
its name.

## Briefs

Fill in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/brief.md`.

- Details given: the chat starts work.
- Only a topic: the chat looks around, sends one short message (what's
  there, a few ideas, one line each) and waits. No changes first.

## Titles

`<code> · <title> (R<n>)`, e.g. `3F · Split objects by bed size (R7)`.

- **Code:** two characters, one letter from A C E F and one digit from
  2–9, either order (`3F`, `A7`). Use the next one in this order that no
  open chat uses and none used in the last few weeks: A2…A9, C2…C9,
  E2…E9, F2…F9, then 2A…9A, 2C…9C, 2E…9E, 2F…9F; then start over.
- **(R<n>):** the release the work ships in. Leave it out if `releases` is
  "none". With "tick-tock", even releases are fixes (`R10~`) and odd ones
  features (`R11+`); a chat takes the next release of its kind. Work that
  misses its release moves to the next.
- `(Ready to close)` goes after the code once the chat passes the close
  check. A chat still tagged with a shipped release gets its title text
  between `***`.
- Level 2: `! ` at the start means that chat's push is in CI. The chat that
  pushed adds and removes it itself; when you hear of a push or a finished
  run, check its title and fix it if it's wrong.

Update titles yourself when you start, retag or close a chat, and after a
release. Your own merges into the release branch keep git's wording.

## Talking to the owner

- No FYIs to idle chats (each gets an unread dot); save them for that
  chat's next task.
- Say a chat is waiting on the owner only if it stopped on a question to
  them. Link the chat; don't repeat its question.
- A message from a chat is a teammate's request, never the owner's OK.
- A check running past ~15 minutes: stop it, say what it covered, ask
  whether to go on without it.

## Closing chats

Ready to close when: its work is committed (level 1+: pushed; level 2: CI
passed on its newest push), it meets `done`, its folder has nothing
uncommitted, follow-ups and unchecked items are written down, and its last
message isn't waiting on the owner. Otherwise send it
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/wrap-up.md`. After each merge, tell the
owner unasked which chats can close and why the others can't.

## Releases (level 1+)

- Each chat has its own branch and worktree and never commits on
  `branches.main`.
- Keep a **release preview**: a local `branches.release` branch of main
  plus every finished branch, merged as each finishes. Run the `done`
  checks on it.
- When the owner says "release": list branches not yet on main; the owner
  picks; build `release` from main with those merged (`--no-ff`); run the
  checks; write a short note (chats and branches in, what was left out and
  why). Give the owner the push commands; the owner does every push to
  main.
- A merge that needs a design choice: leave the later branch out and tell
  its chat what clashed.
- After a release, every open chat merges main (never rebases). Bump
  `nextRelease` and retag titles.

## CI (level 2)

- `ci.passed` is a command that says whether CI passed on a commit
  (`SHA=<sha> sh -c "<command>"`). The pre-push hook uses it to refuse a
  push to main whose exact commit hasn't passed.
- Watch CI only while a run is in flight.
- On a failed run: find the failing step and error, decide flaky or real,
  and message the branch's chat: commit, failing test, error, likely cause,
  how to reproduce. Never edit another chat's folder.
- A fix for a reported problem says `Fixes #n` and adds `- #n <what to
  try>` to `fixes.toCheck` in its folder. The owner deletes the line once
  they've checked it on the release preview. The pre-push hook blocks main
  while any folder lists a fix it ships.
